# A-Linear-Optimization-Problem
This project models and solves a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) to determine the optimal number of Executive, Office, and Student desks a company should manufacture in order to maximize profit. The model takes into account the limited working hours available in the Cabinet Shop, Finishing Shop, and Crating Shop.
